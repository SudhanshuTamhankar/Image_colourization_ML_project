# 🎨 Image Colourization — Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the implementation of an **Image Colourization** pipeline using deep learning techniques. The project is part of the coursework for the **Introduction to Machine Learning (IML)** course.

We take grayscale art images (drawings, engravings, paintings, etc.) and use neural networks to predict their corresponding color versions.

## 📊 Dataset

We used the following dataset from Kaggle:

🔗 [Art Images: Drawings, Paintings, Sculptures, Engravings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving)

The dataset includes a diverse collection of artistic image types:
- Drawings
- Paintings
- Sculptures
- Engravings
- Iconography

### ⚠️ Note:
Due to GitHub's file size limits, the full dataset is **not included** in this repository. Only a **sample** of the dataset is provided to illustrate the structure.
